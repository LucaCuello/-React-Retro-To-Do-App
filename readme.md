# Retro | To-do App

## About

This is a to-do app made with React.

For the visuals, I've used this [amazing framework](https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css). made by the NES.css team.

I've also used [this](https://github.com/timolins/react-hot-toast/) repo for the toasts/notifications and [this](https://github.com/framer/motion) repo for mount/unmount transitions.
